<h2 class="nj-center">About Me</h2>
	<p>In real life I am a student at a front-end bootcamp, but I may pretend to be an astronaut to make things more interesting while designing web pages for assignments.</p>
	<p>Are you interested in becoming an astronaut like me and visiting the planet Mars one day? <abbr>NASA</abbr> may be interested in hiring you if you are. According the their website:<br>
<blockquote cite="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/postsecondary/features/F_Astronaut_Requirements.html">Within the next few decades, humans could be leaving their footprints on the Red Planet! That's the plan, as <abbr>NASA</abbr> continues to prepare to expand human exploration in the solar system. Astronauts currently work as scientists on the International Space Station -- the test bed for cutting-edge research and technologies that will enable human and robotic exploration of destinations beyond the station's low-Earth orbit. The Orion spacecraft atop the Space Launch System (<abbr>SLS</abbr>) rocket will carry humans farther into space then they have gone before -- beyond the moon and eventually to Mars.</blockquote><br>
<p>Some of the requirements to become an astronaut are:</p>
<ol><li>A bachelor's degree in engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science or mathematics.</li>
<li>At least three years of related professional experience obtained after degree completion OR at least 1,000 hours pilot-in-command time on jet aircraft.</li>
<li>The ability to pass the <abbr>NASA</abbr> long-duration astronaut physical. Distant and near visual acuity must be correctable to 20/20 for each eye. The use of glasses is acceptable.</li>
